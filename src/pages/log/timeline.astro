    <h1 class="timeline-title">⧉ Cypher Drift Log — 2012 to 2025</h1>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2012 — The Break</h2><p>My career in database development ended abruptly. Projects pulled, team gone, and I was isolated with no work. Still employed, but only in name — a psychological game to push me out. <br />Saw Bitcoin mentioned. Ignored it.</p></div>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2013 — False Starts</h2><p>Tried unrelated paths: real estate, marketing. Both crashed hard under legal scrutiny. Lost time, money, and energy.</p></div>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2014 — Learning in Isolation</h2><p>Picked up Windows mobile app dev. Wrong bet. Microsoft buried the platform. Another dead end.</p></div>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2015 — Writing and Watching</h2><p>Started diarizing my redeployment. Learned Chinese. Watched coworkers burn out. Began to record the unraveling.</p></div>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2016 — The Stack Expands</h2><p>Forced leave. Learned Neo4J, Python, ML (Ng's course). Held the line. Was made redundant by year’s end.</p></div>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2017 — Signals in the Noise</h2><p>Dove into ML meetups. Started writing for a crypto startup — paid in ETH. Touched the surface of what was coming, but didn’t dive. Lost track of 1.5 ETH.</p></div>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2018 — Near Misses</h2><p>Neo4J project that never happened. Started authoring EU startup proposals — a grind, but a grind that paid.</p></div>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2019 — Slight Gains</h2><p>Better clients, better wins. Still battling entitlement and non-committal founders. Low yield. High overhead.</p></div>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2020 — The Global Stop</h2><p>Pandemic. The world paused. I didn’t. Kept writing. Lost bids due to client failure — not mine.</p></div>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2021 — Crypto Ghosts and Fractures</h2><p>Scammed briefly. Found my old Metamask. ETH x10 — saved me for a moment. Lost two contracts. Lost focus.</p></div>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2022 — Collapse</h2><p>Picking grapes for $32/day. Lost my dogs. Hit bottom. Heard whispers of ChatGPT. Didn’t get it. Yet.</p></div>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2023 — Desperation and Discovery</h2><p>Gov job. Noisy, soul-breaking. Left after 16 months. One project paid out — barely. But AI caught fire. Began prompting. Began <em>watching</em>.</p></div>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2024 — The Pivot Attempt</h2><p>Built AgenticReports.com with Make.com and AI. Looked for jobs — 40+ applications. No replies. Realized I didn’t want maintenance work, just momentum. The system wasn’t built for someone like me.</p></div>

    <div class="timeline-entry"><h2>2025 — The Real Beginning</h2><p>AIOZ discovery. Two replies — four months late. I’m 57. I’m done waiting. Not building chatbots. Building something <em>bigger</em>. DePIN. DePAI. First steps taken.</p></div>
