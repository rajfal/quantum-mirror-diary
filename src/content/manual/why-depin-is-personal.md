Finding employment was a more engaging task one (upon a time). An ad in paper, maybe online, followed by a customised letter with a CV. Then a reply within 2 weeks max of whether I'd made an interview. Otherwise, a note of how to improve my chances next ditto. Ditto for the interview stage, unless I received an offer by phone..

Today, tons of positions on the net. It's difficult to know what is real or not. I read a report that a lot of companies advertise fake jobs to test the market and determine the depth of the talent pool. So while I put my best foot forward and invest my time, they are deceiving me because they don't intend to hire any one - at this stage.

Lucky to get a reply if I don't get a role. At worst, I may be notified 4 mortgage payments later that regretfully I did not quality. Right, as if I were going to hang around for that long.

Does this encourage me to keep knocking around when clearly something is changing.

I spoke to someone recently and they told me of a stage where an AI interface is interviewing them - a culling stage. 

I do like AI but would I want to put myself through. Not certain. Clearly the writing is on the wall. The next candidate run wil not be made of humans but AI-driven robots that will do the job far faster than I, covering more angles than I can and most certainly will not be asking for a sick day off.

Am I the only one who is feeling this?

'D love to hear from you, if you share the vibe of being overwhelmed and honestly not certain of how to face a fast morphing future.

PPS: How do you establish a rapport with the interviewing panel. Like do I want to work with these people for the foreseeable future? AI will be my boss. Perhaps I should be my own.
