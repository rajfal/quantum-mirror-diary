That moment of restraint in 2025 was more than a personal decision—it was a microcosm of the larger transformation happening in digital infrastructure. The DePIN ecosystem went through multiple waves of hardware speculation, where early adopters burned through capital acquiring soon-to-be-obsolete equipment.
Those who waited, who studied the protocols rather than just purchasing hardware, became the true architects of the new network economy. The ANYONE network I nearly impulse-purchased? Its initial hardware became a footnote. Their protocol evolved, but those who understood its core principles—not just its initial implementation—were the real winners.
Mawari's telco partnerships were just the beginning. What seemed like an impressive feat in 2025 became the standard model for network expansion by 2030. Spatial computing transformed from a niche AR technology to the fundamental layer of urban digital infrastructure.
My restraint wasn't weakness—it was strategic positioning. While others were buying hardware, I was building knowledge capital. The tokens I would eventually earn came from understanding, not just owning.
The most valuable asset in the transition to a decentralized infrastructure wasn't hardware—it was the ability to see the broader pattern, to understand how each protocol connected to larger systemic shifts.
