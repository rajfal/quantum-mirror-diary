***Michael Chen's Retrospective - Sept 17, 2033***
The "Node Selection Crisis of '25" seems almost quaint in retrospect. Today my building's management approached me about expanding our node hub from three floors to five—apparently, our distributed computing backbone has become essential infrastructure for the neighborhood's ambient intelligence layer.
The Subnode Protocol became the backbone nobody predicted. While competitors chased quick yields through inflationary tokenomics, Subnode built actual utility infrastructure. Those first 0.24 SUB tokens I earned in 2025—worth approximately $0.12 then—would be worth about $1,240 today.
What's fascinating isn't the money, but how invisible this revolution was to most people. While public discourse fixated on generative AI applications, the true transformation happened in the validation and authentication infrastructure beneath it all.
The four confirmations I waited for in that cramped apartment became the foundation of my first node cluster. I didn't see the larger pattern then—how humanity was quietly rebuilding the internet's plumbing while everyone else was distracted by its shiny new faucets.
