***Michael Chen's Retrospective - Oct 11, 2033***
From: The Infrastructure Owner's Collective
That modest four-node Naoris setup from 2025 seems almost quaint now. What began as a small cybersecurity footprint evolved into what we now call "infrastructure stacking"—the deliberate layering of complementary protocols that create exponential rather than additive value.
The five-phone Acurast farm I planned back then became the seed of what's now a 200-device distributed computation network. Those early 170 cACU tokens, which seemed trivial at the time, accumulated through the 2027-2030 bear market when most had abandoned the space. Today, they form a substantial portion of our collective's validation rights in the cross-chain oracle network.
Auki.ai's journey has been perhaps the most validating. What was an obscure sub-2 cent token in 2025 became the backbone of urban spatial mapping. Those early Swedish retail implementations and Hong Kong drone communication systems were just the beginning. Their burn mechanism, which seemed like a minor tokenomic detail then, reduced the circulating supply by over 70% as adoption accelerated. The token that once traded below 2 cents now facilitates billions in spatial computation transactions daily.
The "physical-digital bridge" philosophy that guided those early decisions proved prescient. While purely digital protocols competed for increasingly commoditized computing resources, those that solved tangible real-world problems became essential infrastructure.
What's most remarkable isn't the financial return—though that has been substantial—but rather how these early infrastructure positions secured our place in the new economy. We didn't just own tokens; we owned rights to essential network functions in a world increasingly dependent on decentralized physical infrastructure.
