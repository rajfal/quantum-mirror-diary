This phrase was born from watching multiple industries fail to adapt, then watching mesh networks rise in response. This is the *infra shift* — a handover of responsibility. Or rather a take-up of responsibility where it was previously ceded by default in a previous age where power, command & control, regulatory influence, human and financial resources were consolidated by corporate structures that towered over human rights, wellbeing and interests.
