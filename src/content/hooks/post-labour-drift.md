After being redeployed in 2012, I experienced a disconnect not just from income, but from structure and the social/professional connections that work had provided As well as the core identity that I derived from exchanging active skills for money, peer recognition, demand for my contribution. 
This 'drift' is a lingering state — one that reshapes how we relate to contribution and systems.

DePIN offers not just reemployment, but redeployment with sovereignty.
