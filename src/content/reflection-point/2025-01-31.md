***Failed experiments contain more valuable data than successful ones.***
What appears as economic failure in a single implementation often contains the precise feedback needed to correct fundamental design flaws in the larger system. The AIOZ experience represented a common pattern in technological evolution: early implementations must expose their economic inconsistencies before the market can develop sustainable alternatives. By documenting both the technical functionality and the economic failure, you were unknowingly participating in a distributed debugging process that would eventually produce systems capable of delivering genuine value to participants at all scales.
