The most powerful infrastructure is often invisible until it fails, just as the most valuable network contributions are rarely apparent at inception. The path from router buttons to mesh sovereignty wasn't linear but fractal – each apparent obstacle creating branching possibilities that eventually connected in unexpected ways. This tension between immediate utility and eventual significance remains the central paradox of decentralized systems – we build not primarily for what they can do today, but for how they might evolve tomorrow.

PS:
VIRAL ESSENCE:
In 2025, I reset a router button to keep my nodes running. By 2033, those nodes helped build systems that made traditional banking obsolete. The revolution wasn't in the technology but in the persistence—centralizers block what they fear, decentralizers build what they imagine. Your "failed" projects today contain the DNA of tomorrow's solutions.
