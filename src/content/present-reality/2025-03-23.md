***Node Selection Paralysis***
Today marked my fourth straight hour staring at competing DePIN project specifications. The Helium 5G miner costs 3× what I budgeted, while the SuiNodeX requires less upfront investment but with unproven tokenomics. My apartment is slowly transforming into a hardware laboratory—old cast off phones, cables snaking between routers, small industrial-looking beaten up laptops blinking in corners.
I finally chose the Subnode Protocol despite its technical complexity. Why? The tokenomics suggests genuine utility: validators earn transaction fees from actual data being processed rather than just inflationary rewards, or speculative ICOs. My intuition says real utility creates lasting value, not quick profits.
Setup failed twice before success. Running diagnostic tests at 2AM while neighbors sleep feels like a strange act of rebellion. Four validation confirmations appeared, then the earnings ticker began its slow climb: 0.24 SUB tokens earned in my first hour.
It feels trivial. Almost foolish. But something inside whispers this is infrastructure for an invisible future.
