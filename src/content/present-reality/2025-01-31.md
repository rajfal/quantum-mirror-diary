***The First Step Into Decentralized Infrastructure***
My journey into decentralized physical infrastructure began with a chance encounter. While browsing RealVision's community reports (where I have free access to some content), I discovered an analysis of a project called AIOZ. The premise seemed straightforward: connect your computer via a software client, provide storage space to global users, and earn AIOZ tokens (then trading around $0.30) as compensation.
Initial hesitation kept me from installing it on my work computer—I simply didn't understand exactly what it would do. Eventually curiosity overcame caution, but I compromised by using my Linux partition rather than Windows 10, allocating 100GB of my available 200GB. Within days, approximately 32GB was utilized, and I observed someone downloading data from my allocated space, generating what the system called "extra revenue."
Despite reading multiple articles on their website, I couldn't grasp the full technical picture of what was happening on my machine. After three weeks, I abandoned the experiment for several reasons:
First, the earnings were negligible—0.00006750 AIOZ tokens, amounting to a fraction of a penny. Second, though my computer had a GPU, it never engaged for computation, eliminating a potential income source. Most problematically, the active file movement coincided with my home internet outage, forcing me to use my phone as a hotspot. My phone overheated dramatically while I exhausted a month's data allowance within days, costing an additional $18 in top-ups. Economically, it was a clear loss.
The model likely works better for operators with terabytes of storage and robust internet connections, but for my modest setup, it was unsustainable.
However, this initial failed experiment opened a door. Researching the minimal value of my AIOZ earnings led me to discover an entire universe of DePIN projects—infrastructure neither controlled by government nor corporate entities. Through blockchain and related technologies, these projects are quietly challenging regulation-protected monopolies and oligopolies.
While my AIOZ experience proved financially disappointing, it initiated what I now believe will be a meaningful journey. More significantly, it exposed me to a profound concept: "What if capital no longer needs human labor?" This question shattered my conceptual framework about the future of work and economic participation.
My first DePIN experiment failed, but the intellectual journey it triggered may prove invaluable.
