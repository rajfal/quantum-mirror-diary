***Building My Digital Sovereignty Stack***
Today was about hardening the infrastructure layer. The ANYONE network caught my attention—a genuinely decentralized VPN alternative that eliminates the need to trust corporate promises of "no logging." The hardware node costs around $400, but oddly they don't ship to Australia. There's a CLI client installation option that requires careful reading, flagged for tomorrow.
NAORIS proved more immediately accessible—a post-quantum cyberthreat vigilance network that required just a browser extension and wallet connection. Their X following was supposed to grant points but it's not recognizing my account. No matter. I'm considering connecting additional phones as supplementary nodes. The existential threat is clear: quantum computers will eventually crack today's encryption by deriving private keys from public ones—an impossibility for classical computing that now feels inevitable.
Auki.ai presented perhaps the most fascinating proposition—a spatial computing network positioning itself against centralized GPS and AR location services. They're essentially enabling AI to build precise spatial awareness within local environments like shops or homes, creating digital twins of physical spaces that autonomous systems can navigate. Their refusal to cave to predatory VC offers, despite watching their network value temporarily decline, speaks volumes about their integrity. They held out for proper guidance that preserved their community. I'll investigate further.
Meanwhile, my 375go setup passively earned me 92 tokens this week, likely from scanning 5G activity every 10 minutes during my drives. The multi-tasking capability of my phone continues to impress—multiple protocols running simultaneously.
I've been using NotebookLM to conceptualize these protocols as strategic games, which helps clarify their underlying mechanics and incentive structures.
Michael's insight about infrastructure versus applications resonates strongly. While everyone chases flashy front-ends, the true revolution lies in the plumbing, the sewers, the pipework. I'm becoming increasingly selective about which projects actually solve fundamental problems versus those merely riding trends.
My BlockDAG phone farm is temporarily offline. I'll let the system time out completely before resetting in the morning.
