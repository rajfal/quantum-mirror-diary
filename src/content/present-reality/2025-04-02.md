***Expanding The Infrastructure Footprint***
The last few days have been productive in expanding my DePIN node network. I successfully restored an older laptop and installed another Naoris Node, bringing my total to three owned nodes plus one referred node. All four are now generating tokens 24 hours a day, creating a small but steady stream of digital assets secured against future quantum threats.
My part-time Acurast implementation has proven surprisingly effective, generating over 170 cACU tokens. This success has sparked a decision to scale up with intention: I'm planning to order five new low-priced but correctly-specified phones to establish a small dedicated phone farm. This represents a shift from opportunistic to deliberate infrastructure building.
My research into Auki.ai's spatial computing framework has yielded fascinating real-world implementation details. They're already deploying retail shopping solutions in Sweden and collaborating with Hong Kong authorities on what appears to be Low Elevation Architecture—possibly drone communication infrastructure. Their tokenomics model includes a burn mechanism where tokens are destroyed with each network transaction, creating potential deflationary pressure. With the token price currently below 2 cents and my growing conviction about the foundational nature of spatial computing, this appears to be an asymmetric bet worth making.
Minima.global remains a puzzle I need to solve. I have one node running on my phone, but I'm still uncertain about its functionality or token generation mechanisms. It represents an information gap in my infrastructure strategy.
My focus is increasingly clear: I'm building bridges between digital solutions and physical-world problems. The projects that span both realms—creating tangible utility rather than purely digital abstractions—are where I'm concentrating my efforts and resources.
