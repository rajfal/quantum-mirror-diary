***Clarity Through Focus: Identifying True Infrastructure Plays***
The past few days have had several revelations. I delved deeper into Auki.ai through their founder's, Nils, discussions about decentralized spatial computing—the critical infrastructure that will enable physical AI to operate effectively in the physical world we occupy. These conversations sparked an important realization: not all DePIN projects are created equal.
What separates truly foundational infrastructure from merely interesting technology? The answer seems clear now—it's the bridge between digital intelligence and physical reality. Without solutions like Auki's, robots and AI remain trapped in digital environments, unable to navigate and interact with the world of physical humans who need tangible solutions to real life problems.
I reflect on my earlier investments: $220 into BlockDAG and $50 into Qubetics. These commitments came before I fully grasped the concept of nodes within the DePIN landscape. While not regrettable, they represent a less focused approach than I now seek to pursue.
My path forward is crystallizing: I need to identify and commit to projects that solve obvious present-day problems while simultaneously laying groundwork for long-term infrastructure. The scattered approach of acquiring disparate hardware or chasing activity-based projects now seems inefficient.
The physical realm applications will ultimately speak loudest in this revolution. One day, I aspire to be part of a syndicate that owns robot fleets as income-producing assets. But that future begins with establishing the right foundational infrastructure today—not by chasing every shiny opportunity that presents itself.
This isn't just about financial returns. It's about being part of building something that fundamentally transforms how digital and physical realms interact.
