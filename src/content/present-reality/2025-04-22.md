***Node Expansion and Network Hurdles***
Finally got back online after discovering the most mundane solution to my connectivity issues – a nearly invisible router reset button that had to be pressed to enable the 2.4/5G signal. The temporary outage affected everything: my BlockDAG phones went offline, though interestingly my Naoris nodes actually scored higher than usual once restored. Most importantly, Acurast is back up and running, which is critical timing since I just received five new phones from China today. I'm eager to test their Android compatibility and capacity to host full Acurast nodes. Still need to port my Lite Processor node to the Acurast network to properly account for the $cACU tokens I've accumulated over the past month.
Had an unexpected friction point with traditional finance today. Apparently, my AUKI crypto purchase triggered an automatic block on my bank card despite having sufficient funds. After some frustrating back-and-forth, I tracked down the issue to an overzealous fraud team that "proactively" blocked my card without notification. It's unblocked now, but these clashes between traditional banking and crypto operations continue to create unnecessary friction. The irony of needing centralized permission to participate in decentralized systems isn't lost on me.
I've been pruning my DePIN portfolio, retiring projects that lack clear value propositions. DeNet is already gone, and now Ambios is on the chopping block. Their concept of evaluating restaurant environments (light levels, ambience, noise) seemed promising, but the execution is flawed – forcing a five-minute lag between evaluations makes the process inefficient. I spent half an hour downtown and only completed five venues, when I could have done triple that. The token utility remains unclear, unlike their air quality node which accumulates points 24/7. Meanwhile, Azen Network has stopped offering daily check-in and social media points while we're still waiting for their TGE with no clear timeline. Their USD 999 node is beyond my budget, and their social media AI agent that reformats viral memes feels gimmicky compared to what I can already do with NotebookLM. For now, I'm focusing on researching the XMAQUINA auction to join their DAO and exploring how to set up an AUKI domain at my location.
