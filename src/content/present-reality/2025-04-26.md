***DePIN Hardware Setbacks and Alternative Pathways***
The last 12 hours have been a complete disappointment with the Acurast network. After receiving five phones from China last week, I've hit a wall with implementation. I tried factory resets to install the non-Android OS APK, but couldn't access the QR mode needed to scan the package location on their GitHub repo. When I attempted a direct APK download, the system rejected it with an error message. My final attempt—logging in through my Google Account to access the verified package via PlayStore—revealed the crushing truth: despite being advertised as Android 14, the PlayStore indicated these devices simply won't run the Acurast Lite Processor.
This setback forces me to return all five phones to China. While I'll get my refund, that's not what I wanted. My vision of building a decentralized phone compute farm is slipping away right when Acurast's TGE (Token Generation Event) is approaching. I'd hoped to be generating pre-TGE tokens from multiple devices by now. The original Vodaphones were equally disappointing—supposedly minimum version 12, but incompatible nonetheless. That's eight phones total that have failed. Even my personal Motorola G04 refuses to connect its Lite Processor to the Acurast Hub despite multiple QR code connection attempts.
With Acurast hitting a dead end, I'm surveying other options. Mawari, the 3D Spatial VR DePIN, will be offering nodes for sale at $333 in June—not a bad entry point with enough advance notice to budget for it. Naoris Protocol, the cybersecurity network, announced an upcoming token presale. And in three days, XMaquina is running their second $DEUS token auction to expand their decentralized physical AI DAO. The landscape offers numerous paths forward—I just need to determine which one aligns with my resources and long-term strategy after this hardware setback.
