Those who built decentralized identity and encryption systems before the crisis weren’t just protected—they became the foundation for rebuilding. The early $400 nodes now command $12,000 on secondary markets, not that anyone sells them anymore.\r\nNAORIS tokens experienced similarly explosive growth, but more importantly, their distributed threat detection system identified the earliest signs of quantum attacks weeks before formal acknowledgment. Those additional phones I connected as supplementary nodes? They now form part of our building’s autonomous security mesh, with computational capacity rented to neighboring structures.\r\nBut Auki.ai proved most prescient. Their spatial computing network, once dismissed as niche, now powers nearly every autonomous delivery system and home robot. By creating a decentralized alternative to GPS and centralized spatial computing, they effectively wrote the rulebook for how AI navigates physical space.
